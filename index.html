Most bodybuilders frequently vary their exercises when training for hypertrophy and balanced growth, depending on their specific goals, the time allotted to reach those goals, and their current training split. As a result, bodybuilders have hundreds of movements in their exercise arsenal. Nonetheless, each lifter has unique biomechanics, which makes them biased toward certain exercises.

If you only have 10 exercises for the rest of time to stay as muscular as possible, give me the list.

In a podcast published on July 5, 2023, the four-time reigning Classic Physique Olympia champion Chris Bumstead revealed his 10 staple exercises for building muscle mass to Chris Williamson on the Muscle Wisdom podcast. Check out the video below, courtesy of Williamson’s YouTube channel:

Chris Bumstead’s Go-To 10 Exercises To Build Muscle
In response to Williamson’s request, Bumstead obliged with the following list:



Barbell Back Squat
Barbell Deadlift
Neutral-Grip Pull-Ups
Incline Dumbbell Bench Press
Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press
Close-Grip Barbell Bench Press
Dumbbell Biceps Curl
Bent-Over Row
Hanging Leg Raise
Lateral Raise or Overhead Triceps Extension
Barbell Back Squat
The squats are on the top of Bumstead’s list of 10 best exercises to build muscle mass. It was the first exercise he named in response to the question with nearly no hesitation. The four-time Classic Physique Olympia champ favors the squats for their overall lower body-building potential. 

“If it’s my whole life, I might actually do Smith machine squats,” said Bumstead. The Smith machine squats complement Bumstead’s mechanics — they are easier on his knees. The fixed track for the barbell provides better stability than a free-weight barbell, which helps Bumstead bias on his glutes and quads. 

I love squatting in the Smith machine, and I get a lot of shi* for that.

Barbell Deadlift
Bumstead chose deadlifts as the second exercise, which targets the hamstrings, glutes, and back. He doesn’t have to include dedicated exercises for these muscle groups, as this compound lift builds the posterior chain. This left Bumstead some extra room to vary the remaining eight lifts on the list.</p>
